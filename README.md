Learning how to create vectors and transform them using matrices has been critical in analyzing code, connecting libraries, and applying new properties or parameters to the constructors for a better Object Oriented Approach to building executable code. 

The design process for the code is as follows: building objects using vertices, transforming their positions relative to the world view/space, scaling the objects as they are processed by the vertex shader, applying textures to objects that require a certain design/look and also applying lighting/materials to the objects so that our virtual world is viewable and has a feeling of reality using lighting. 

Future work could include assisting developers at my current job with troubleshooting graphics applications.  Another practical application of the skills learned here could be for building interactive and immersive learning platforms (like a LMS).  Using graphics to teach how networks are built and visualizing the traffic flowing through represented mediums could be a powerful tool for guiding young (and old) students into a technological advantage. 


There were no new development strategies other than the OpenGL design process.  Building workable code requires time and effort through troubleshooting and testing within multiple iterations.  Iteration is crucial because of the nature of programming a virtual world, there will be things missed in the first draft.  During the milestones, a pivot to an easier scene was adopted after understanding the immense task of building complex objects through composition of basic shapes.  

Learning about computer graphics and visualizations gave me new knowledge on the power of matrix multiplication.  Given the advent of AI, particularly Large Language Models, matrix multiplication/operations are used to determine the desired weights for nodes to either release an output or to not release an output.  With this knowledge, I could further my career and knowledge within the growing space of AI.
